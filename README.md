Seaborn Data Visualization Projects
Overview
This repository features a series of data visualization projects that delve into various popular datasets using Python's Seaborn and Pandas libraries. The projects aim to demonstrate the power of visual data exploration to uncover insights and patterns. The datasets used include:

1. Tips dataset: Analyzes tipping behavior in relation to meal times and party sizes.
2. Gapminder dataset: Explores global trends such as GDP, life expectancy, and population.
3. Titanic dataset: Investigates survival rates and factors affecting survival on the Titanic.
4. Iris dataset: Examines the characteristics of different iris species.

Projects and Highlights
1. Tips Dataset Analysis
Visualizes relationships between total bills, tips, and other factors.
Explores tipping behaviors by time of day and party size.
2. Gapminder Dataset Exploration
Analyzes trends in life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population over time.
Compares regional progress and disparities.
3. Titanic Survival Analysis
Investigates factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic.
Examines passenger class, sex, age, and fare as key variables.
4. Iris Dataset Classification
Visualizes the distribution of features among iris species.
Explores the use of different features in classifying iris species.
